Install samba for network access to the Pi's drive(s)
- sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
 
Open samba configuration file
- sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Add to end of samba configuration (/etc/samba/smb.conf):
[PiDrive]
   comment = SD on Pi
   path = /home/pi/PiDrive
   valid users = @users
   force group = users
   create mask = 0660
   directory mask = 0771
   read only = no
   
Restart Samba
- sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart

At this point we need to add in a user that can access the Pi’s samba shares. We’re going to make an account with the username PiDriveUser and the password ppp. To do so type the following commands:
- sudo useradd PiDriveUser -m -G users
- sudo passwd PiDriveUser

You’ll be prompted to type in the password twice to confirm. 
- pass: ppp

After confirming the password, it’s time to add PiDriveUser as a legitimate Samba user. Enter the following command:
- sudo smbpasswd -a PiDriveUser
